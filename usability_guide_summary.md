# Don't Make Me Think, Revisited - Chapter Summaries & Implementation Guide

## Chapter 1: Don't Make Me Think! - Krug's First Law of Usability

### Summary
The fundamental principle of usability: web pages should be self-evident. Users shouldn't have to think about how to use things. When looking at a page, it should be obvious what it is and how to use it without expending mental effort.

### Key Concepts

  - Document areas where users might think "What is this?"

- [ ] **Simplify naming conventions**
  - Replace clever/cute names with obvious ones
  - Use familiar terminology over company jargon
  - Make clickable elements obviously clickable

- [ ] **Test the "neighbor test"**
  - Show your homepage to someone unfamiliar with your business

## Chapter 2: How We Really Use the Web - Scanning, Satisficing, and Muddling Through

### Summary
Users don't read web pages—they scan them. They don't make optimal choices—they satisfice (pick the first reasonable option). They don't figure out how things work—they muddle through with incomplete understanding.

### Key Concepts

## Chapter 4: Animal, Vegetable, or Mineral? - Why Users Like Mindless Choices

## Chapter 8: "The Farmer and the Cowman Should Be Friends" - Why Most Arguments About Usability Are a Waste of Time
